              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Role: UX Designer & Researcher
              <br />Tools: Figma
              <br />The Purpose: To expand my portfolio by remaking an app from Audible reviews.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <P>According to reviews on the google play store there are numerous design problems. Due to this many have stopped using the service in frustration.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <P>To improve the overall user experience by adding more features, deleting useless features and by making the user face more user friendly.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Google Play App Store Reviews Analysis</h2>
              <h3>Strengths</h3>

              <p>Easy to download audiobooks
              <br />The option to archive books from the library
              <br />The books are fantastic
              <br />Can listen while the screen is off
              <br />Listening while offline</P>

              <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
              <p>User Interface is confusing
              <br />Skipping
              <br />Battery Draining
              <br />Won't Load audiobooks that are downloaded with poor service
              <br />Search Results move when you click on a title and hit the back button
              <br />Hard to search for free books
              <br />No way to cancel subscription in the app and if there is it's next to impossible to find
              <br />No way to easily buy extra credits in the app
              <br />Lacks a spot to manage payments
              <br />Lacks a cart or add to cart option in the app
              <br />No way to easily find archived books
              <br />No way to see the price of audiobooks in the app
              <br />Doesn't have the option to show chapter and book progress at the same time even though there's room on the page for it
              <br />No custom speed presets so you don't have to struggle to hit the right speed
              <br />The up and down arrows button doesn't swap first for last and so on
              <br />During driving the fast forward 30s is the default instead of rewind 30s as most people use rewind and not fastforward in that situation
              <br />No length filter option
              <br />There's a more options button which only leads to a wishlist, it could be removed and wishlist could be directly on the first button
              <br />No sales page
              <br />The horizontal menu is annoying and outdated and the other 3 options are barely used
              <br />The discover tab is poitnless as the home page does the same thing and there is a search bar at the top
              <br />No option to buy only 1 credit</P>
