              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Role: UX Designer
              <br />Duration: June 2021 - July 2021
              <br />Tools: Marvel, Balsamiq
              <br />The Purpose: I had to develop a mock app to complete Career Foundry’s Intro to UX Course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <P>How might we design a mobile app that empowers people to learn new vocabulary?</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <P>Flowcabulary will provide users with an easy to use very customizable simple vocaulary app.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <h3>Flashcard Maker - Study Fast:</h3>
              <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>Free
              <br />Name that is clear and concise to the purpose of the app
              <br />Able to make multiple sets
              <br />There is a most used sets category
              <br />Able to add images to cards
              <br />No annoying pop up ads
              <br />Reverse cards button
              <br />Statistics button
              <br />You can label a set of cards
              <br />You can save and go back
              <br />You can choose a color for flash card sets and the whole bundle even in the flashcard set page is colored that way(but not individual flashcards)
              <br />You can 50+ characters in a label name
              <br />There is a backup and restore option
              <br />There is a deleted section to retrieve deleted sets or delete forever
              <br />Easy to slide back and forth between cards
              <br />The menu board using three lines and it doesn't cover the whole screen is nice as many apps do that so it is very familiar. It's nice you don't have to press an extras button to add sets, instead at the bottom right there is a button for that, which you can easily use.</p>
              <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
              <p>Decent logo but instead of the letter F there should be the word Flashcard
              <br />You can only have either an image or text but not both on one side of a card
              <br />There shouldn't be a rate us in three dots at the top right as it makes it seem like there is a user important function there which there is not. The button is completely redundant as there is a button under the About tab that literally brings you to the same link to rate the app on Google play
              <br />No way to share flashcard sets with others
              <br />No preexisting flashcards so you have to make all your own
              <br />No sign in so you can't easily access them from other devices
              <br />The help button just shows you what it showed you when opening the app for the first time after downloading it. But there is very little to need help with so I suppose that makes some sense
              <br />To flip the card you need to click on a small button on the bottom right of every card, instead you should be able to click on the whole card and instead of clicking on the card to edit it there should be an edit mode to edit cards
              <br />When you click to add text the keyboard doesn't immediately pop up with the box to add text instead you have to click on the box to add text for it to pop up which is inconvenient when trying to mass create cards
              <br />There is a back arrow button for flashcards sets but none when you go into the "help" and the "about" tabs</p>

              <h3>Brainscape</h3>
              <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>You can find flashcards people have made
              <br />Easy to sign up with Google
              <br />There is a website that you can access your account through</p>
              <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
              <p>The name doesn't make it obvious what the app is about
              <br />The logo is confusing and doesn't indicate at all or in any way that this app is a flashcard app
              <br />When in the sidebar to exit it you have to hit the back button on the phone because there is no button on the app, I would add a swipe right for the sidebar to open instead of just hitting the button with three lines. Also you can't click in the dead space to go back from the sidebar which is inconvenient.
              <br />There is little to no organization of the sidebar and the first thing there is an upgrade button
              <br />The rate me pop up is very inconvenient
              <br />To create flashcards you have to use the website</P>

              <h3>Quizlet</h3>
              <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>You can find flashcards people have made
              <br />Easy to sign up with Google
              <br />There is a Night Theme option in the app
              <br />There is a website you can access your account from
              <br />You can change your username
              <br />You save sets for offline use
              <br />It gives a list of recommended sets
              <br />You can play live games with other people, very useful for classes especially because the teacher can make sets and then play a study game with the students
              <br />You can get ad free studying when you refer a friend(which probably helps the app spread.)
              <br />You can set study reminder notifications
              <br />Easy to find the logout button
              <br />There are some advanced features if you pay for an annual membership
              <br />You either view both sides of the cards all at once or you can view one side for flash card mode
              <br />To view the other side of the card all you have to do is tap on the card
              <br />There is a back button for the cards and to get to the next one all you have to do is swipe to either side
              <br />There is an option to have the text read to you
              <br />The cards have a shuffle option
              <br />It shows you your progress on how many cards you’ve gone through
              <br />The app icon is very simple which is easy to remember
              <br />Very creative, simple, and concise name
              <br />There is a multiple choice option
              <br />There is a matching option for the flashcards which makes it more of a game
              <br />There is a test mode which has true and false options, typed answers, and multiple choices and doesn’t let you see what you got until the end and it lets you see what you got right and wrong
              <br />You can star flashcards
              <br />Swiping left in flashcard mode puts it in the I don’t know category while swiping right means you know it
              <br />For both sides you can have text 100+ characters long</p>
              <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
              <p>There is an upgrade button in top right of the app when you open it and there is another when you go to the profile page, which is redundant for such a simple app
              <br />You can only change your username once
              <br />There is an ad on the bottom of the home screen
              <br />You can’t add images to cards without paying for it
              <br />The app icon isn’t self explanatory at all</P>

              <h2>User Personas</h2>
              <P>I created one teenager user personas as the target audience is for those using flashcards which tends to be children.</P>

              <h3>User Persona struggles</h3>
              <p>To get good grades to go to college
              <br />A way to access vocabulary sets on the go, as Josh is very busy and constantly on the move, he would forget physical flashcards if he made them.
              <br />The ability to download the sets to be able to study even when without phone service or internet as he is often in the car going through dead zones in service.
              <br />The ability to access the account from a computer when his phone dies and for when he is at school so the teacher doesn’t think he is playing on his phone.
              <br />To get an A on vocabulary quizzes/tests
              <br />To waste as little time on studying as possible
              <br />Have as much fun everyday without being overburdened by homework and studying
              <br />A notification system so he doesn’t forget to study
              </p>

              <P>I had four users test the prototype, here are there results.</P>

            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Early Failures</h2>
              <P>In the wireframing step I forgot to put a button for signing up after you fill out your information. I also almost forgot to add a button to go back to the sets page from the navigation bar so I crammed it in between two other buttons on the drawn wireframes. I almost forgot to create a settings page even though one of my tasks required it. I made the wireframes digital due to my terrible drawing skills and handwriting.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <P>Learning a new job isn’t as hard as I make it out to be in my head. Keep working at it until you finish, progress is the name of the game. I really enjoyed researching and analyzing apps in the beginning process. I didn’t enjoy the user interviews. The hardest part for me was the wireframing task as I’m not very visually artistic.</P>
