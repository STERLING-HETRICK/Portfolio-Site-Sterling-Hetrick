            <p>A habit tracking app that not only allows you to track good habits to increase but also bad habits to decrease.</p>

              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Role: UX Designer
              <br />Duration: July 2021 - February 2022
              <br />Tools: Adobe XD, Balsamiq
              <br />The Purpose: I had to develop a mock app to complete Career Foundry’s UX Immersion Course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <P>People are looking for an app to help them focus on their health and wellbeing, that makes them feel safe by not sharing their information, doesn’t cost anything to use, has practical actionable advice, can be used on the go with little friction, and fulfills diverse needs.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <P>Habitualize will provide users with an easy to use very customizable simple habit tracking app. Users will also be able to see what their friends are doing and join in community challenges which strengthen the users connection with the app.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <h3>Google Fit</h3>
              <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>Very easy to sign up if you have a google account
              <br />Well known name
              <br />You can connect other health apps like Strava to it so it can synthesize information
              <br />Automatically records data</p>
              <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
              <p>Lack of mental health tracking as it’s only physical
              <br />No way to turn off features like Cycle Tracking which is useless to Men</p>
              <h3>Better Me: Health Coaching</h3>
              <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>Has more than just physical health tracking as it has stuff like breaking bad habits like addictions
              <br />Has many different types of training including running, weights, dance, kegel, boxing, fitness at home, gym, tabata, etc
              <br />Even has workouts for individuals in wheelchairs</p>
              <h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
              <p>Is limited in the dietary plans as it only has a handful of mainstream diets for example it’s lacking the carnivore diet
              <br />Many things aren’t very accurately names or are inconsistently named like for example Vegetarian is on the diet list twice and the second says plant based. Technically that is wrong as they are both plant based but the one that says plant based should say Vegan
              <br />Missing subject names, could not find calisthenics which is one of the most well known types of workouts
              <br />Lack of habits to track
              <br />Charging money to join challenges, if anything it takes away motivation when the app should be giving it</P>

              <P>I created three adult user personas as the target audience is for those interested in self improvement which is usually adults.</P>

              <h2>Prototype</h2>
              <P>I learned how to use Adobe XD.</P>

            <div>
              <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
              <P>I had six participants test the prototype and they came across a few major issues that had to be resolved immediately as well as many other smaller issues.</P>

            <div>
              <h2>Iteration</h2>
              <P>I went through quite a few iterations and changed the look many times when including accessibility into my design along with more consistent color schemes.</P>

            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <P>Overall the project turned out well. I ended up finishing the project early though I feel as though I could have been much more efficient and finished it earlier. The research, ideation and iteration stages went particularly well. I could more improvement in the design with aspects like spacing. Even though I could improve a lot I made lot of improvement from my initial designs which seemed very archaic and lacked a good style. For example I drastically improved the color contrast as my initial design and even with some iterations, had color contrasts failing all three levels of contrast, "A", "AA", and "AAA". I made quite a few major errors like forgetting the challenged on the home page, even though it was one of the points in the onboarding page. Before I fixed it I even had the button accepting the challenge bring you to the home page once hit, without any indication of where the challenge was to be found. Luckily during user testing I received feedback that pointed this out. I forgot quite a few buttons like the button from the Log In page to the Sign Up which would have potentially prevented people from Signing up. I also forgot the "Log In" button on the Log In page which would have prevented anyone from logging in. One of the biggest challenges was learning how to use some of the tools like Adobe XD which wasn't very intuitive for me. I ended up watching a few YouTube videos to figure it out and I had to play around a lot and ask my mentor a few questions to figure out how to get Icons imported into the application. You will never get it right from the start. The key is continually revising and improving the product and the process.</P>
