            <p>I designed and coded this website myself, it works on computers, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>

              <h2>Project Overview</h2>
              <p>Role: UX Designer and Front End Developer
              <br />Duration: March 2022 - April 2022
              <br />Tools: Atom Text Editor, Github
              <br />The Purpose: I had to create a portfolio website for Career Foundryâ€™s Front End Development Course.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <P>How might we create a portfolio website?</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <P>The Portfolio Webiste will provide viewers case studies for my projects as well as contact information and information about me.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
              <p>I started by looking at example of finished portfolio websites on Careerfoundry.</P>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>Prototype</h2>
              <P>I originally made my first prototype using Wixsite</P>

            </div>


            <div>
              <h2>Failures</h2>
              <P>I had no clue that to get an html document to load on a browser it needs to be label ".html" otherwise it doesn't recognize it as one. I had a problem with the footer floating into the middle of the page due to an error in the css, which is was particulary hard to figure out what was causing it. I learned a lot from YouTube including that I needed a folder for images with the images in the website folder to get photoes to appear on the website. Figuring out how to turn the htm document into an actual website was challenging as I had no clue how to do that. The hardest problem I had to deal with was getting the hamburger menu to work at all. It turns out I'd forgotten a key part, the javascript.</P>

            <div>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <P>HTML, CSS, and Javascript are challenging to learn but not as difficult as I'd thought. I also learned that small mistakes can lead to huge errors like not being able to load the document in a browser. Fortunately there are lots of packages that can be added onto Atom Text Editor to make the whole process much easier.</P>
